# html-eu-cv
European Style Curriculum Vitae (Résumé) Template, in HTML+CSS

## Motivation
Different aspects of your CV may be more or less relevant to different employers or different sectors. Comparing different versions of your CV can be burdensome, especially if the customization consist in rephrasing sentences, rather than just "pruning a master CV".  
Since HTML source is textual, hope is that comparing different versions should be easier, at least to the coding-inclined person.  
Another obvious motivation, is that some people may prefer HTML, CSS to other formats.

## How-To
### If you are comfortable with HTML and CSS
Most likely you know *more than I do*, so download the files and use them at your will.
### If you know just a little about HTML and CSS
That "little" you know about HTML is probably enough to use this template.  
Download the **html** and **.css** into the same directory, and edit the **.html** file. Replace default values with your details, duplicate and edit HTML elements as required.
Note how some units are enclosed in a `<table>` element, so you will need to duplicate the whole `<table>...</table>` section to add a working experience, an academic title and so on.  
Of course, deal with styling issues by editing the **.css** file as far as practical.  
Hint: if you feel confused about how the table parts are organized and nested, you may (temporarily) add recognizable borders to the styles of table, td, and the various .cv-... classes. 
### If you don't know anything at all about HTML
Well... I didn't really expect you to come here and IMHO you are not going to enjoy using the template. That said, if you *are learning* HTML, it could make sense to give it a try and/or to come back later.  
### Printing
When you are done with the editing (and/or the comparison of different versions), my idea was that you would *print* the result to a PDF file. Review the printing options, however! For example my browser by default includes the URL of the file, which makes no sense in a CV.  
Hint: try setting the content of the `<title>` HTML element and see if the result is ok for you, otherwise, you may just leave it empty.
### CV Comparison
To compare different versions of your CV, a [file comparison tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_comparison) could be useful.  
I am not recommending any tool in particular, but since the task is not very complex, you won't need a sophisticated one.  
Compare the **.html** files (as text files) to compare the content and the **.css** files for styling and formatting.  
## Licensing Note (Moral Rights)
It is the author's intention to license this CV template in the most permissive way, ideally releasing it into the "Public Domain" (see LICENSE file). He is waiving away every right that can be waived away, so that users are allowed to use the CV template as if they had written it themselves.
However, in most European countries, authors are not allowed to waive away a class of rights named **[moral rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_rights)**, which refer to attribution and related issues. Since the template is aimed at European citizens (the author being a EU citizen too), we decided to investigate the issue at least a bit.
